SAVI 2026 invites contributions in the spirit of an open, idea-driven workshop. This is a space to share cool ideas, new directions, early results, work-in-progress, conceptual sketches, fresh connections, emerging themes, and interesting questions. SAVI topics include:

- Foundations and theory of e-values and test martingales
- Anytime-valid and sequential hypothesis testing
- Optional stopping, optional continuation, and adaptive data analysis
- E-values versus p-values and Bayes factors
- Multiple testing and false discovery control with e-values
- E-values for model selection and comparison
- Game-theoretic statistics, connections to game-theoretic probability and online learning
- E-values in causal inference and adaptive experimentation
- Applications in machine learning, A/B testing, and data streams
- E-values for high-dimensional and nonparametric inference
- Software, computation, and practical implementation of e-values
- Case studies of e-values in real-world scientific and industrial settings

If you’re exploring something exciting in e-values---or something adjacent that should be part of the e-values world---we’d love to hear about it.

By proposing a contribution, you may apply for either a:
- Poster slot, or a
- Talk slot (30 min). A talk slot includes a poster slot.

In either case, the material need not be finished now. We need a summary of the contours your content. That is enough to allow us to compose a program that’s stimulating, diverse, exploratory, and full of intellectual energy.

Additional notes:
- Multiple submissions per person are absolutely fine
- You’re welcome to apply for both posters and talks
- Collaborative, interdisciplinary, and unconventional submissions are encouraged
- Early-career researchers and new community members are especially welcome

We may face more demand for talk slots than we have in supply, in which case we may have to offer you a poster slot.




Timeline: Send in your application by **April 1st 2026 AoE.**

We are looking for your (working) title together with a ≤ 900 character summary with ≤ 5 keywords for context. We will ask for your public title and abstract at a later point.

We accept submissions through [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyf-PJ2o1bDnskhAC0qzKOtutl7FysEHqjqw9m24gyTU0k5Q/viewform?usp=header).
